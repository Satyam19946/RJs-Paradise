## Welcome to RJ's User Page

[Pictures](#Pictures)

I am currently a 3rd year Computer Science major at University of California, San Diego. I currently code in C++I honestly do not know why I chose to major in CS but I know it has something to do with my interest in computers. I was and still am super hands on person and technical. I just hope it brings me money. 

I hope to one day enter the industry just for a little bit to gain some experience. One day I will like to become a teacher. Maybe even get 5 star rating on Rate My Professor.

### About Me



- I love to take walks on the beach.
- Watching anime and reading manga is something I love to do on my off time. 
- When I am not doing the two above I also read books (Currently reading Duke Pendragon).
- Also I have many nicknames. To shorten my full name, a lot of friends call me RJ but my family and close family members call me Joda. 

- Little _secret_ about me is when it is called for I will party pretty hard and can hold my liquor. 


Here is my anime list and my reviews about them. It is not completely updated as I have to comb through a bunch to review them all. Will take me a while.

My favorite quote by Confucius

> “We have two lives, and the second begins when we realize we only have one.”
